    * Clients and their lawyers use this app to communicate with each other.
  * You can also share important files with said client.
  * Used for communication among lawyers in a law firm.
  * Can also be used for calling and not just texting.
  * Also has a search bar
  * You can see Unread Text Messages you have received.
  * Side Note: Uses a lot of AI which I personally don't like. Most people don't like AI either. Especially when it comes to apps that are used by LAWYERS.
