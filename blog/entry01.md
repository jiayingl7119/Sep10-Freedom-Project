<h1>SEP 10 Freedom Project</h1>
<h3> Why I Chose My Topic</h3>

<p>As a student of the Software Engineering Program in HSTAT(High School of Telecommunitcation and Arts), I will be able to create a Freedom Project. The topics I have chosen are Law Firm, Fashion Designer, and Baking. The topic I will be doing my Freedom Project on is being apart of a Law Firm. The reason for picking this topic is because I prefer debating and bringing justice to criminals. After all, courts don't usually help the victims, rather the criminals. Hence why my interest in being in a Law Firm is so high. To add on, courts usually appeal to criminals rather than bringing justice to them. Leaving many, including myself, unfufilled and wanting the court to actually do their job. In joining the Law Firm Industry, I will fufill that unfufilled justice in many hearts. </p>

<p> Researching such topic has led me to explore more on what my future career might be. Like <a href="https://www.nalp.org/what_do_lawyers_do" alt="what do lawyers actually do"</a> </p>
