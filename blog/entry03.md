<h1>SEP 10 Freedom Project</h1>

<h2>The Law Firm Industry</h2>
<p> While working for the law firms, you get experience. These experiences include how to manage your time, investigating, and also more knowledge. You learn to manage your time when you're going to work. After all, court does not wait for the laweyr to show up for trials.</p>

<p> You get better in investigating because the job of a lawyer is to investigate deeper into a case. This will include the evidence they give. Such as if the client is recording a scene in a public area or private. As many know, you can freely recorrd anything if it is in public. However if it is private, then it would be considered illegal. </p>

<h2> Links</h2>

<p> There are multiple links to mulitple websites for lawyers. The ones mentioned before are included. For Evernote: <a href="https://evernote.com/why-evernote">Evernote Website</a>. This website explains why you should use Evernote. Especially because of note-taking if you are having to take a lot of notes. For RingCentral: <a href="https://www.ringcentral.com/us/en/blog/">RingCentral Website</a>. This is mainly AI. However, it is useful for lawyers that are busy and gives them time to adjust to their client.</p>

<h2> Engineering Design Process</h2>

<p> This is still the second stage. The second stage includes examples of apps related to the law firm. After all, there is no specific app for law firms. Stage three is going to be the actual part where I am going to brainstorm ideas for future apps for law firms. The main problem is developing a website where clients can find lawyers. Which is what I am trying to solve.</p>


<h2> Skills </h2>

<h6> Organization </h6>
<p> I always have my things organized and I will have dedicated sections to whatever I have going on in the day. This will either include stars, a list, or color coding. I have found many of my things as I grow because of how I organize my notes. This is helpful when I have tests and projects that need the information that is directly stated in my notes.</p>

<h6> Work Ethic</h6>
<p> I waste no time when it comes to work. When I do my work, I pay attention to every detail. I finish my work efficiently and correctly. There will be no mistakes since I will double check everything I work on. This also includes writing and reading. I will take in every detail and store it somewhere where I know I will find it. </p>

<h6> Creativity</h6>
<p> With a bunch of references and energy, I can draw good and also write stories. For instance, I helped my friend edit their story from 6th to 8th grade. To add on, I also have written stories of my own. Not to mention several characters that all have backstories, detailed descriptions, and more.</p>
