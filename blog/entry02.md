# Entry 2: Decided Topic (Law Firm)

<h1>SEP 10 Freedom Project</h1>

<h2> Why I Chose The Law Firm Industry</h2>

<p> The topics I've chosen were Law Firm, Fashion Designing, and Baking. I chose law because I used to want to be one when I was younger. To add on, I also liked debating. Since lawyers always debate, I think it would be perfect for me. I've learned about what's illegal and legal, watched movies about law, and about gathering evidence for a court trial. I considered fashion designing because I've always wated to make clothes. But I figured that it wouldn't work well because I have no idea how to sew and also don't really know what colors match with what when stressed. Baking also wasn't much of an option because one, I don't have much ingredients. And two, I cannot cook. So, the law firm was an obvious choice when I thought about it.</p>

<p> During Part 1, I now know about multiple apps that lawyers use. There are obviously no lawyer apps specifically for lawyers. However, the best apps that lawyers USE are Evernote and RingCentral. Evernote is an app for note taking. It was made for lawyers to organize their notes and it can sync to all devices. Which is useful because lawyers are always on the move. In RignCentral, clients and lawyers communicate easier. It is used to set meetings online, call for any concerns, and more.  </p>

<h2> Links</h2>

<p> There are multiple links to mulitple websites for lawyers. The ones mentioned before are included. For Evernote: <a href="https://evernote.com/why-evernote">Evernote Website</a>. This website explains why you should use Evernote. Especially because of note-taking if you are having to take a lot of notes. For RingCentral: <a href="https://www.ringcentral.com/us/en/blog/">RingCentral Website</a>. This is mainly AI. However, it is useful for lawyers that are busy and gives them time to adjust to their client.</p>
