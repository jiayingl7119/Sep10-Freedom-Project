<h2> Why I Chose The Law Firm Industry</h2>

<p> The topics I've chosen were Law Firm, Fashion Designing, and Baking. I chose law because I used to want to be one when I was younger. To add on, I also liked debating.

I considered fashion designing because I've always wated to make clothes. But I figured that it wouldn't work well because I have no idea how to sew and also don't really know what colors match with what when stressed.
